<h2>Projects</h2><br>
<h3>Real-time object detection using the ESP32-S3 microcontroller</h3><br>
 Our project focuses on real-time object detection using the ESP32-S3 microcontroller
 The goal was to create a lightweight and efficient system that could detect objects within the
 ESP32-S3's resource constraints.<br>
->Implementation<br>
->Dataset and Training:<br>
"We used a dataset of approximately 2.2k images and labels, splitting it into training, testing, and validation subsets. The YOLOv5n model was trained with parameters like a 320x320 image size, 
 50 epochs, and a batch size of 16, achieving precise results."<br>
->Optimization:<br>
"We pruned 20% of the model weights to reduce size and fine-tuned it for optimal performance. 
 The optimized model was converted to TensorFlow Lite format and further quantized to uint8 format to improve compatibility with the ESP32-S3."<br>
-> Deployment:<br>
"The uint8 TFLite model was integrated into the ESP32-S3. We wrote source files for camera setup, inference handling, and bounding box visualization. The system streamed live detection
 results via Wi-Fi, with bounding box coordinates visible on a hosted 
 web page and the serial monitor."<br>

 
<h3>DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY ON HEALTHCARE</h3><br>
->In this project, we presented a comprehensive framework that integrates state-of-the-art
privacy-preserving techniques, addressing the critical privacy concern in healthcare data.<br>
->The main goal of our project is to strengthen the confidentiality of individual records by
implementing differential privacy, a paradigm that is widely acknowledged. The Laplace
mechanism is utilized to incorporate precisely calibrated noise into numeric columns in the database, like
'Age,' 'Billing Amount,' and 'Room Number,' maintaining data integrity while augmenting
privacy.<br>
->Data masking is incorporated to anonymize columns, like 'Medical
Condition' and 'Name,' by restricting their representation to a specific maximum length.<br>
->Applying hashing to tokenization, specific columns such as 'Hospital,' 'Insurance Provider,' and
'Medication' are protected against security breaches.<br>
->To give users concrete control over the degree of privacy they desire to
preserve, the project presents the idea of a privacy budget (Îµ) as a parameter. <br>
-> This comprehensive method yields a refined healthcare dataset, establishing the groundwork for
responsible data handling and adding to the ongoing conversation about privacy in the
healthcare industry.<br>
